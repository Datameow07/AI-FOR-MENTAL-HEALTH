This project utilizes machine learning to predict MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality types based on text input. It incorporates features like sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and textual patterns to accurately classify users into one of the 16 MBTI types. The model is trained on a large dataset to ensure precise predictions, making it a useful tool for understanding personality traits through natural language processing.
